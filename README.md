# Notchly AI

## About
I was very annoyed at having to switch windows and have a bunch of apps open just to use AI, so I created this, which makes use of the notch on newer Macs to launch a simple integration of llama.

## Installation
[Install the app](https://github.com/nanoticity/Notchly-AI/releases/tag/v3) and go to your Downloads folder. From there drag it into your applications folder and it is ready to use!
